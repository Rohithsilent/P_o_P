@technosite2956,"Dude!!! You gotta start a Data Science course. 

- Universities are sh*t in these areas. and not only do we have to spend massive money on Tuition but also another massive money on online courses to cover for what university is doing.

- I also rely on you so much because you give the course in such fun way to love coding Plus to make it entertaining to watch unlike Collage. You also make us do exercises and then you make step by step solutions on what we missed. Honestly with your courses Universities doesn't stand a chance.

- You will find a lot of students here or even graduates apply to your courses if you make a Data Science course. I know it's tough to make. but Honestly I think No one like you make coding that much fun.

I hope you consider making these courses. <3"
@sjreditingadda337,Please make a video on AI Engineers
@sandy6T9,who wants complete data science course on python by Mosh ?? like here

@TheAnchor2626,Thank you Sir
@reallmehrshad,üëè
@SuffyanAsad,"Many companies consider processing big data and data wrangling as part of data scientist's job, so big data should be learnt earlier in the roadmap, perhaps after getting familiar with numpy and Pandas. Second, getting familiar with a public cloud is not mentioned here, which is also an essential skill in many jobs. 

The specifics often depends on the role, and the job expectations vary widely, some focusing more on the Data Science side, and other roles like ML Engineer focus somewhat more on data engineering and product building side. 

So use this well put together roadmap as a framework, and tweak it according to your career goals."

@faizansaeed9126,Thank you for this invaluable content. Please make a video on the road map of Data Engineering
@EyedenTT,"Bro i just did bsc in physics ,now i am thinking about switching . But I don't really know what to do"
@nickst0ne,"Thanks for the video. I'm not set on becoming a data scientist, but it's reassuring to see that with a background as a software engineer, and previously data analyst, pivoting towards data scientist would not require a lot of efforts."
@grazvy3477,"The math part is just delusional or exaggerated to sound easy. 
I studied computer science at TUM. All those math modules combined would be 30 university credits, each representing 30 HOURS, resulting with 900 in total.
On average, this is enough to barely pass the exams.
He's talking about self study in a non-professional environment and ""mastering"" it in 2-3 months, this is crazy.
It would take 22 full-time weeks to get 900 hours with good resources at hand, but ""mastering"" would only be possible for the 3%, optimistically speaking."
